Pretty simple approach, simple code as well. The UI manager includes a special class for popups to increase reusability. 
 
The UI might look a little weird though because there were a few missing box and separator UI images so I just used the ones already there in the folder so some boxes may look stretched but that is an easy fix. My figma was not working otherwise I would have made those images myself. 

Looking forward to hearing from the team soon :)
